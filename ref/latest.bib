pages="363--372",
abstract="Static cache partitioning can reduce inter-application cache interference and improve the composite performance of a cache-polluted application and a cache-sensitive application when they run on cores that share the last level cache in the same multi-core processor. In a virtualized system, since different applications might run on different virtual machines (VMs) in different time, it is inapplicable to partition the cache statically in advance. This paper proposes a dynamic cache partitioning scheme that makes use of hot page detection and page migration to improve the composite performance of co-hosted virtual machines dynamically according to prior knowledge of cache-sensitive applications. Experimental results show that the overhead of our page migration scheme is low, while in most cases, the composite performance is an improvement over free composition.",

abstract="Memory virtualization is an important part in the design of virtual machine monitors (VMM). In this paper, we proposed dynamic memory mapping (DMM)model, a mechanism that allows the VMM to change the mapping between a virtual machine's physical memory and the underlying hardware resource while the virtual machine is running. By utilizing DMM, the VMM can implement many novel memory management policies, such as Demand Paging, Swapping, Ballooning, Memory Sharing and Copy-On-Write, while preserving compatibility with various architectures. The modular and hierarchical property of the DMM model efficiently incorporates the high-level policies and the low-level implementations, leading to a feature-adjustable VMM design. We presented the principle of the DMM model, and explained the procedures of various memory management policies under this model. Also, we implement the DMM model in KVM, an open source VMM. Our evaluation shows that the DMM model is efficient enough to provide the benefits of dynamic memory resource management with little performance impact.",

  year={2002}, 
  pages={301-310}, 
  abstract={Attainment of software performance assurances in open, largely unpredictable environments has recently become an important focus for real-time research. Unlike closed embedded systems, many contemporary distributed real-time applications operate in environments where offered load and available resources suffer considerable random fluctuations, thereby complicating the performance assurance problem. Feedback control theory has recently been identified as a promising analytic foundation for controlling performance of such unpredictable, poorly modeled software systems, the same way other engineering disciplines have used this theory for physical process control. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of ControlWare, a middleware QoS-control architecture based on control theory, motivated by the needs of performance-assured Internet services. It offers a new type of guarantees we call convergence guarantees that lie between hard and probabilistic guarantees. The efficacy of the architecture in achieving its QoS goals under realistic load conditions is demonstrated in the context of web server and proxy QoS management.},
